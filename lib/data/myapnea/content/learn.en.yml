    - question: What is Sleep Apnea?
      answer: |
       Sleep apnea is a common and potentially life-threatening sleep and breathing disorder. With sleep apnea, breathing is repeatedly interrupted during sleep, sometimes hundreds of times during the night and often for a minute or longer. Left untreated, sleep apnea increases the risk for high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, and other medical conditions. It has been estimated that at least 18 million Americans have sleep apnea, but it often goes unrecognized and untreated. MyApnea.Org aims to mobilize the sleep apnea community to work together to get better answers through community support and research. Once diagnosed, sleep apnea can be successfully treated and should not interfere with your job or quality of life.
