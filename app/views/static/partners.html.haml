        %h5.f300
          The American Sleep Apnea Association (ASAA), founded in 1990, is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that promotes awareness of sleep apnea, works for continuing improvements in treatments for this serious disease, and advocates for the interests of sleep apnea patients. Its mission is to reduce injury, disability, and death from sleep apnea and to enhance the wellbeing of those affected by this common disorder. The ASAA promotes education and awareness, coordinates the A.W.A.K.E. Network of voluntary support groups, and promotes research and continuous improvement of care.

        %h5.f300
          Brigham and Women’s Hospital Sleep Medicine Epidemiology Program (SMEP) is an integrated research and clinical program that aims to improve the care of patients with sleep disorders through clinical trials and comparative effectiveness research. SMEP also is a leader in data management for sleep disorders research. It has served as the data coordinating center for comparative effectiveness studies and clinical trials that evaluate sleep apnea interventions. SMEP also has pioneered a novel informatics platform to support sleep research through initiatives supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

        %h5.f300
          Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) is an international leader in virtually every area of medicine and has been the site of pioneering breakthroughs that have improved lives around the world. A major teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School, BWH has a legacy of excellence that continues to grow year after year.
          The Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorders was formed in 2013 by the Departments of Medicine and Neurology to unify the delivery of clinical care, increase educational opportunities, and promote interdisciplinary research in the fields of sleep and circadian biology. Its mission is to forge a path of discovery in sleep medicine while providing the highest standard of clinical care for patients with sleep disorders and training the next generation of leaders in sleep and circadian biology.

        %h5.f300
          The Shared Health Research Information Network (SHRINE) helps researchers overcome one of the greatest problems in population-based research: compiling large groups of well-characterized patients. Eligible investigators may use the SHRINE web-based query tool to determine the aggregate total number of patients at participating hospitals who meet a given set of inclusion and exclusion criteria (currently demographics, diagnoses, medications, and selected laboratory values).
