  %p
    %strong We will use your information for research.
  %p
    We collect information about you, your health, and some of your behaviors.
    This information will be used in research and will be presented in
    scientific conferences and published in scientific journals. These
    presentations and publications will never show any information that
    identifies you or any other individual in the study. We will share summary
    information that does not contain any identifying information with other
    participants in the network, which include members of the National Patient
    Centered Outcomes Network and research partners in MyApnea.Org. While we
    think that there are only minimal risks associated with sharing research
    results, we cannot predict how this information might be used in the future.
    We take many safety measures to protect your privacy, but we cannot
    guarantee that your identity will never be known.

  %p

    Data and the web portal will be housed on the Partners HealthCare Research
    Computing Cloud Infrastructure. The Discovery Information Platform for

    HealthCare secure data center and within the Partners HealthCare network.
    All systems are secured behind the Partners HealthCare firewall and follow
    Partners HealthCare Information Security policies for authenticated, minimum
    access. All systems are patched, monitored and scanned routinely for
    vulnerabilities and intrusions by the systems administrator and PHS

    with state and federal government standards, regulations, and in accordance
    with Partners Security and Privacy policies. The web server and database
