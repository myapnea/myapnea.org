      %h2 Does treatment of sleep apnea influence body weight?
  .content-body.horizontal-inset
    %p.lead
      By conducting more research on how sleep apnea treatments influence body weight and one’s quality of life, researchers hope to provide the tools necessary for treatment providers to deliver the best possible care to their patients. You can get involved in this research by completing our surveys within the research portal of MyApnea.Org.

      %h2 Does sleep influence memory and “brain plasticity”?
  .content-body.horizontal-inset
    %p.lead
      Sleep is important to strengthen memories created during the day. Sleep is also important to help the brain get rid of toxins that may impair the brain circuits needed for memory. Poor sleep can negatively impact memory and brain plasticity. There are well-described effects of sleep deprivation, sleep disruption and low levels of oxygen on brain function. Poor sleep negatively affects the brain’s memory center (hippocampus) and also impairs processes associated with “brain plasticity.”

      %h2 Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Adenotonsillectomy in Children
  .content-body.horizontal-inset
    %p.lead
      While adenotonsillectomy for sleep apnea in children is generally safe, there may be specific groups that have an increased risk of complications related to surgery, including very young and African-American children. In these groups, more intensive monitoring in the post-surgery period may be warranted. The association between severity of sleep apnea and complications points out the importance of obtaining a sleep study before surgery to determine relative risk.

  .content-body.horizontal-inset
    %p.lead
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are both very common, each affecting around 10% of adults in the United States.  Unfortunately, T2DM and OSA often go hand-in-hand.  It has been known for some time that there are a large number of people who have both conditions, although there is evidence that OSA is often undiagnosed.

      %h2 Can Nighttime Oxygen Use Replace CPAP for Treatment of Sleep Apnea?
  .content-body.horizontal-inset
    %p.lead
      Over the years, my colleagues and I have had requests to prescribe oxygen for treating sleep apnea in patients who do not tolerate CPAP. This made some sense since some of the complications of sleep apnea are driven by a lack of oxygen during periods of apnea. However, there has been little research addressing the role of oxygen as a sleep apnea treatment. We therefore designed the Heart Biomarker Evaluation in Apnea Treatment (HeartBEAT) study.

    %p.lead
      In 2005, the British Medical Journal published a research study that made the American Thoracic Society International Conference “Top 5 Articles of the Year”, and since has remained a frequently talked about study that has also seemingly gained a cult following.  In a randomized controlled research study, Dr. Braendli’s team in Switzerland discovered that playing the didgeridoo, a native Australian wind instrument, resulted in improvement in obstructive sleep apnea (or OSA).

      Unilateral stimulation of the hypoglossal nerve (the nerve that controls the movement of the tongue) is a new treatment for people with moderate to severe OSA who are unable to use continuous positive prtessure therapy (CPAP).

      %h2 New Study Shows Women with Sleep Apnea at Increased Risk for Heart Disease As They Age
  .content-body.horizontal-inset
    %p.lead
      In a recent study, my colleagues at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Columbia University and Baylor Medical Center and I found that older women are at higher relative risk of developing sleep apnea-related heart disease than older men.  This study turns on its head the notion that sleep apnea is a “man’s” disease- that is, traditional thinking that men are both more likely to have sleep apnea and have sleep apnea-related health problems.
