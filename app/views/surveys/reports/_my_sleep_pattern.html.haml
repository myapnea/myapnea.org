      The National Sleep Foundation recommends all adults over the age of 18 to get a minimum of 7 hours of sleep every night. Nearly half of all US Americans report getting less than the recommended amount of sleep, which contributes to a myriad of health and mental problems.

      Having the same bedtime and wake up time on workdays and weekends could help you fall asleep and stay asleep all night because it helps keep your body's clock regular.

      Some people prefer to wake up earlier in the morning and go to bed earlier at night. Others prefer to sleep later in the morning and stay up later at night. People who wake up early are sometimes called

      and people who stay up late are sometimes called
      %span.primary-blue night owls
      . Researchers study the body's internal clock, or circadian rhythm, to learn more about the differences between morning larks and night owls.

      Normal scores are less than 10. Scores of 11 or more indicate sleepiness, with scores greater than 16 indicating high levels of sleepiness.  Sleepiness may occur because of untreated sleep apnea, inadequately treated sleep apnea, not getting enough sleep per night (most adults need 7 to 8 hours of sleep per night), or another sleep disorder.

      If your score is greater than 10, you may want to talk to your health care provider as well as review your sleep habits to make sure you are getting 7 to 8 hours of sleep per night.
